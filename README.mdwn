Sticky.js
-------------

Stick elements to the viewport, being able to change its behavior after and before it sticks

## Usage

It's really simple *you won't see any $() here*

```javascript

// You don't need me to say that you should have some html for the demo and include the script, do you?

var aside = document.getElementsByTagName('aside');
// You can use any other native selector, like getElementById, querySelector, etc.

new Sticky(aside, {
	//margin: 5, // margin (in pixels) with the top of the viewport

	stick: function(){
		console.log("It's following you now");
	},
	unstick: function() {
		console.log('Back to normal');
	}
});

```
