Sticky.js
-------------

Stick elements to the viewport, being able to change its behavior after and before it sticks

## Usage

It's really simple *you won't see any $() here*

```javascript

// You don't need me to say that you should have some html for the demo and include the script, do you?

var aside = document.getElementsByTagname('aside');

new Sticky(aside, {

	//spacing: 5, // margin (in pixels) with the top of the viewport

	stick: function(){

		console.log("It's following you now");

	},

	unstick: function() {

		console.log('Back to normal');

	}

});

```
